## Numerical Differentiation

From the definition of *`f'(x)`* :

The above formula to find the dervative of *`f(x)`* is called the *forward difference formula*, however, there are other two types of formula as well to find the derivative, as follows :

***Backward Difference Formula***



***Central Difference Formula***
