## Linear Regression Projects

Under linear regression projects, we have two types of problems :

1. Linear Regression With One Variable
2. Linear Regression With Multiple Variable

### Linear Regression With One Variable
---
***Project Brief :***

The CEO of a restaurant franchise wants to open new outlets in different cities, where they already have their food trucks

We have given a dataset of two columns, where
- 1st Column : City Population
- 2nd Column : Profit made by the Food truck in that city

Now, we have to determine in which city they have to expand their outlets.
